###Step 5. Statistics  
The field of meta-statistics is a rich and fascinating set of tools, literature, and discussions. Herein, we direct the practioner to several extremely useful resources associated with this specific topic. To become competent with an open science worflow for meta-analysis, a detailed knowledge of the statistics is of course preferable but not critical. A viable philosphy for the appropriate application of meta-statistics is best defined by the following set of assumptions. (1) Know thy 'derived' data and the limitations of the set of research summarized. This informs the statistics. (2) All statistics are a tool and a means to end - not the end. (3) The formal application of statistics to data from the t-test to the most advanced analysis you can imagine is an exercise in model fitting. A model is a representation of an idea. Period. Statistics are thus one mechanism that provides the evidence-based synthesis researcher with a tool to represent the ideas that stimulated the synthesis. No more, no less. (4) Description of the patterns across a set of studies or datasets is a powerful discovery tool. Do not underestimate the power of... this side of synthesis (or the force). (5) A meta-analysis is not an experiment and does not directly test a hypothesis. It can provide quantitative evidence and probabilities associed with strength of evidence, differences, and consistency and establish a weighted description of the efficacy of different interventions very broadly. (6) Even more profoundly and not uncommonly, meta-analysis as an open science synthesis research tool can highlight research gaps. (7) An ideal starting point is to assume that simple meta-statistics are akin to an ANOVA but for a population of relatively-independent singular data points. This constellation of points can be modeled as fixed or random. More advanced meta-analyses or differences in the type of data simply shift the perspective from ANOVA to reframing as a GLM (same thing) but then slides along to GLMM and this broader family of thinking. Not dissimilar from primary data statistical thinking. The difference is that we do not have one 'data' but 'many representative data'. Very Seussian. There are four primary processes associated with the statistics step of an open science approach to meta-analysis.  

**Key meta-statistical processes**
(a) calculate effect size(s)  
(b) visualize effect size data (typically a forest plot)  
(c) fit a meta-statistical model  
(d) explore heterogeneity and bias  

###Open science product  
A [forest plot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forest_plot) is typically the primary open science research product and assumed to be included in some form within the synthesis publication as a key figure. Ideally, contemporary open science researcher should also publicly and openly disseminate the statistical workflow - i.e. share R code illuminating this element of the workflow and ensuring the meta-statistics like the search and sort processes are reproducible.
