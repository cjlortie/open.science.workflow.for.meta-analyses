###Step 1. Sort  
Now the fun begins. Search your returned hits for appropriate studies that satisfy the criteria that you list a priori. Typically, there are a set of simple assumptions for exclusion criteria for a meta-analysis in evidence-based research. 



###Open science product
The key element to capture is the criteria. The most typical mechanism to capture the sort workflow is a PRISMA report, and some disciplines have not been as rapid in adopting this synthesis summary tool. A nice description of its importance [here](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1890/15.WB.018/full).
