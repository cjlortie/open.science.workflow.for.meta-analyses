###Step 1. Search  
Identify and list your search tool or resource. This is an evolving landscape and sensitivity is important. Best practices include the following attributes.  
a. document all search instances and record total number of returned hits   
b. explore search term sensitivity and synonyms in detail  
c. test >1 bibliometric resource  
d. do not add publications 'by hand' or haphazardly  
e. do check select publications (seminal and/or top cited) to calibrate search terms  
f. use abstract surveys to ensure you are capturing the correct set of literature  

###Open science product
To document search process, at the minimum generate an 'evidence matrix'. The evidence matrix as a synthesis tool was formally pioneered by the evidence-based synthesis expert for public health [Joseph Lau](https://www.brown.edu/academics/public-health/research/evidence-synthesis-in-health/news/2015-08/joseph-lau-retires). It has changed significant, but it a form of summary table highlighting frequencies of search terms to illuminate the frequency of the *conjunction* of ideas.

Within a contemporary workflow in R, the most facile representation is a table, and there are many excellent packages suitable for tables.

###Case study
```{r evidence matrix, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}


```


###Exercise


###Conclusion
1. A reproducible search for evidence objects is critical for any synthesis.  
2. A table that shows the conjuction of related concepts and their relative frequency of detection within a bibliometric resource is recommended.  
3. There are many other viable mechanisms to communicate a search process including correlation matrix viz, wordclouds, ontologies with weighting, and conventional count/frequency data viz tools.

Here is an excellent example of [alt-viz](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1611.02119.pdf).
